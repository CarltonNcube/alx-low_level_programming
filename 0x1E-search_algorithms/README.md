C - Search Algorithms
Description
This project explores various search algorithms implemented in the C programming language. It includes basic linear search, binary search, jump search, interpolation search, exponential search, and an advanced binary search.

Tasks
0. Linear search
Implement a function for linear search in an array of integers.

1. Binary search
Implement a function for binary search in a sorted array of integers.

2. Big O #0
Explore the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search.

3. Big O #1
Explore the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search.

4. Big O #2
Explore the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search.

5. Big O #3
Explore the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search.

6. Big O #4
Analyze the space complexity of a given function/algorithm.

7. Jump search
Implement a function for jump search in a sorted array of integers.

8. Big O #5
Explore the time complexity (average case) of a jump search using step = sqrt(n).

9. Interpolation search
Implement a function for interpolation search in a sorted array of integers.

10. Exponential search
Implement a function for exponential search in a sorted array of integers.

11. Advanced binary search
